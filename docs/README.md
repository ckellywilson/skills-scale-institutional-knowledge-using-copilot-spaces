# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

**Welcome!** This is your starting point for understanding how OctoAcme manages projects from concept to delivery.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new team member or looking to understand our processes, this guide will help you navigate our documentation.

## Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

## Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation** – Validate the problem, align stakeholders, define success criteria
2. **Planning** – Break work into increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies
3. **Execution** – Build, test, review, and iterate in sprints
4. **Release** – Deploy to production with proper verification and communication
5. **Close & Retrospective** – Capture learnings and celebrate wins

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

## Communication Cadence

- **Daily**: Team standups (15 min) – progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Twice weekly**: Delivery team syncs as needed
- **Weekly**: PM + PdM alignment meetings
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder status updates
- **Per sprint/milestone**: Demos and retrospectives
